uShallNotPass is a password manager built for offline use.

It's database is secured with AES256 encryption and has a secure wipe functionality.
It's capable of generating passwords of any length to varying degrees of complexity listed here:
          1 - all lower case letters.
          2 - lower + upper case letters.
          3 - lower + upper case letters + numbers.
          4 - lower + upper case letters + numbers + symbols.
          5 - currently the same as 4 but will eventualy make sure that characters
              are selected evenly, to avoid level 4 passwords that dont contain
              numbers for example.

Any input regarding security flaws are welcomed and appreciated as are any feature ideas.
